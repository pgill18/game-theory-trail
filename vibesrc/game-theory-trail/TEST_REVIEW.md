# Game Theory Trail - Test Review & Fixes

## ‚úÖ Code Review Completed

### Files Checked:
- [x] types.ts - All types properly defined
- [x] constants.ts - All constants exported correctly
- [x] utils.ts - Pure functions, no side effects
- [x] gameEngine.ts - Game logic isolated and testable
- [x] useGameState.ts - Reducer logic comprehensive
- [x] GameTheoryTrail.tsx - Main component wired correctly
- [x] All component files - Props properly typed

### Issues Found & Fixed:

#### 1. ‚úÖ TrailSVG onClick behavior (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Completed platforms couldn't be clicked when auto-play enabled
- **Fix**: Allow all platforms to be clicked, gate logic in reducer
- **Location**: `components/TrailSVG.tsx:149`

### Potential Improvements Identified:

#### 2. useEffect dependency on autoPlay callback
- **Status**: NOT AN ISSUE - correctly implemented with useCallback
- **Reason**: autoPlay is memoized and will only change when dependencies change

#### 3. Missing error handling
- **Status**: TO BE ADDED in feature enhancement phase
- **Recommendation**: Add error boundaries

#### 4. No accessibility features
- **Status**: TO BE ADDED in feature enhancement phase
- **Recommendation**: Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
